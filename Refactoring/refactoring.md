# New concepts / differences from JavaScript

## Simpler if

Instead of:

    if condition
        # Do something!
    end

Do this

    expression if boolean

i.e.

    puts "It's true!" if true

> No need for 'end'

Same goes for unless:

    puts "Some string" unless true == false

Ruby does ternary expressions as well

    puts 3 < 4 ? "3 is less than 4!" : "3 is not less than 4."
